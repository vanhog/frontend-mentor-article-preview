## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
-  [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)



### What I learned

- To call a snackbar a "snackbar" (or even a "toast") ;-)
- to use the classList Method 

```html
function showSomePopup() {
  	var thisIcon = document.getElementById('shareline');
  	
  	thisIcon.classList.toggle('hidden');
}
```
- using Tailwindcss and custom css classes together

### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [W3School's snackbar example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_snackbar.asp) - This helped me to figure out, how to handle snackbars.

- [Walid's article preview solution] (https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/article-preview-using-js-and-css-and-html-jrvhw5PHtb) - This helped me to apply the w3-example.
